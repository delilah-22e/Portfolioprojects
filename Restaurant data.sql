Project Overview
This project involves exploring and analyzing data from a restaurant to gain insights into the performance of different menu items and overall order trends. The analysis can help understand customer preferences, peak ordering times, and the pricing strategy of menu items.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following main tables:

Menu_items: Contains information about the menu items, including their names, prices, and categories.
Order_details: Contains information about the orders placed, including order details and timestamps.

SQL Queries
The SQL file (Restaurant data.sql) contains several queries designed to answer specific business questions:


--List all menu items along with their prices.
SELECT item_name,price
FROM `Restaurant_data.Menu_items`

--How many orders were placed in total?
 SELECT COUNT(order_details_id) as total_orders
 FROM `Restaurant_data.Order_details`

--What are the unique categories of menu items available?
SELECT DISTINCT category
 FROM `Restaurant_data.Menu_items` 

--What is the average price of menu items?
select AVG(price)
from `Restaurant_data.Menu_items`

--Which menu item has the highest price?
SELECT item_name 
FROM `Restaurant_data.Menu_items`
WHERE price =(SELECT MAX(price) 
     FROM `Restaurant_data.Menu_items`)

--List the top 5 menu items ordered the most.
WITH Favourite_items as (SELECT item_name,COUNT(menu_item_id) as total_count
FROM `Restaurant_data.Menu_items` AS MI inner join `Restaurant_data.Order_details` AS OD ON MI.menu_item_id=OD.item_id
GROUP BY item_name
ORDER BY total_count DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT item_name 
FROM Favourite_items


--Find the category with the highest average price of its items.
SELECT category
FROM(SELECT category, AVG(price) as avg_price
      FROM `Restaurant_data.Menu_items`
       GROUP BY category)
ORDER BY avg_price DESC
LIMIT 1

--List menu items that have never been ordered.

SELECT item_name, item_id,order_details_id
FROM `Restaurant_data.Menu_items` AS RDM LEFT JOIN `Restaurant_data.Order_details` AS ROD
ON RDM.menu_item_id= ROD.item_id
WHERE ROD.item_id IS NULL


--What time of the day has the most orders term it as peak hours.
SELECT 
  Time_period,
  COUNT(order_details_id) AS Total_orders
FROM (
  SELECT 
    order_details_id,order_time,
    CASE 
      WHEN order_time BETWEEN '00:00:00 AM' AND '05:59:59 AM' THEN 'Night'
      WHEN order_time BETWEEN '06:00:00 AM' AND '11:59:59 AM' THEN 'Breakfast'
      WHEN order_time BETWEEN '12:00:00 PM' AND '5:59:59 PM' THEN 'Lunch'
      WHEN order_time BETWEEN '6:00:00 PM' AND '9:59:59 PM' THEN 'Dinner'
    END AS Time_period
  FROM `Restaurant_data.Order_details`
) AS Order_periods

GROUP BY Time_period
ORDER BY Total_orders DESC
 -- Use the code as is to see performance of all times of the day.
 -- To see just the one time wityh most oprders, execute the line below.
--LIMIT 1

--What is the total revenue generated from orders on a specific date?
 
SELECT order_date, SUM(price) AS Total_revenue
     FROM `Restaurant_data.Order_details` AS a 
     INNER JOIN `Restaurant_data.Menu_items` AS b
     ON a.item_id= b.menu_item_id
     GROUP BY order_date

--Revenue Month on Month

SELECT FORMAT_DATE('%B', order_date) AS month,SUM(price) AS Total_revenue
     FROM `Restaurant_data.Order_details` AS a 
     INNER JOIN `Restaurant_data.Menu_items` AS b
     ON a.item_id= b.menu_item_id
     GROUP BY month

Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of restaurant data, helping to uncover valuable insights about menu performance, customer preferences, and peak ordering times. These insights can aid in making informed business decisions to enhance restaurant operations and customer satisfaction.
